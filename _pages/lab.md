The Computational Science and Machine Learning Lab (CSML) is an interdisciplinary research lab that focuses on advancing scientific computation through the integration of computational and algorithmic techniques with machine learning methods.



## Research Focus



Our research interests span a wide range of topics, including data-driven modeling and simulation, uncertainty quantification, and optimization. We use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in  deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian learning to develop robust and efficient solutions to these problems. Our goal is to create novel approaches to scientific computation that bring together traditional methods and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.




## Student Mentorship



At CSML, we believe in providing our students with individual attention, clear expectations, and ongoing support and mentoring on writing, presentation, and programming skills. We are looking for students who have demonstrated strong programming skills, research or project experience, dependability and initiative, and excellent communication skills. As mentors, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our students to learn and grow.
