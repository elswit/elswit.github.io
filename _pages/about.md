I am a post-doctoral associate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu) at Virginia Tech.  My research focus is on science-guided machine learning, numerical methods for multi-physics simulations, and high performance I have also interested in quantitative social science research.

My PhD work was centered around efficient numerical methods for initial value problems. Most of that work has been [published](/publications) in SIAM, Elsevier and Springer journals and [presented](/talks) to the scientific computing community. 

As a post-doc I work with graduate students in [Computational Science Lab at VT](http://csl.cs.vt.edu) on various physics-informed machine learning projects. Some of the [active projects](/research) involve deep neural surrogate models for forward and inverse problems, uncertainty quantification for _physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)_ and solving optimal control using PINNs.
