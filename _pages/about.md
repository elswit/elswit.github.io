### About

I am a post-doctoral associate in the [Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu) Department at Virginia Tech, where I also received my PhD. My main [research](/research) area is in the theory and applications of [scientific machine learning](/research/sci-ml/). I am also interested in using [data science](/research/DPP/) to inform public health and policy decisions.

My PhD thesis focused on efficient numerical methods for initial value problems. Most of that work has been [published](/publications) in SIAM, Elsevier, and Springer journals and [presented](/talks) to the scientific computing community.

I am joining the [Computer Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/computer-engineering-computer-science) Department at California State University, Long Beach, in fall 2023.
