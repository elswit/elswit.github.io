1.  **Scientific Machine learning**
  * Data driven models, System identification, Neural and deep learning for physics-informed applications.
1. **Numerical methods for forward and inverse problems**
  * Ensemble learning, Bayesian inference, and Numerical optimization methods with applied for model order reduction, PDE-Constrained optimization and inverse problems
1. **Quantitative Social science research**
  * Exploratory and explanatory data analysis for chronic disease prevention intervention
  * Quantitative social research at the intersection of online learning and Gerontology 
1. **Time-stepping methods for PDEs**
  * High-order time discretizations for multi-physics systems. Implicit-Explicit, variable time-stepping
and error control strategies. Parallel and Jacobian-free methods Advanced methods for fluid
