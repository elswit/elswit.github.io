I am an assistant professor of computer science in CSU. My research focus is on science-guided machine learning, numerical methods for computer simulations, and high performance computing. I am also interested in quantitative social science research.

Before joining CSU I was a post-doctoral associate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu) at Virginia Tech where I aslo received my PhD. 

My thesis was centered around efficient numerical methods for initial value problems. Most of that work has been [published](/publications) in SIAM, Elsevier and Springer journals and [presented](/talks) to the scientific computing community. 

If you are a CSU student or a PhD student in the joint program with CGU interested in these research areas, consider joining the CSML lab. Please get in touch with me with your CV.
