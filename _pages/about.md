### About Me


I am an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Department at [California State University, Long Beach.](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/computer-engineering-computer-science) My main [research](/research) area is in the theory and applications of [scientific machine learning](/research/sci-ml/). I am also interested in using [data science](/research/DPP/) to inform public health and policy decisions.

Previously, I worked as a post-doc in the Computer Science Department at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu), where I also received my PhD. My thesis focused on efficient numerical methods for initial value problems. Most of that work has been [published](/publications) in SIAM, Elsevier, and Springer journals and was [presented](/talks) to the scientific computing community.
